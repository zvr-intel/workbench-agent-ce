# About the Workbench Agent
The **Workbench-Agent** is a CLI that interacts with **FossID Workbench**. 

This is the Community Edition (CE) of the Workbench Agent maintained by the Customer Success Team. We will do our best to stay on top of any GitHub Issues opened and review any Pull Requests with fixes and improvements (thank you in advance!).

If you prefer a solution with a contracted SLA, please use the official Workbench Agent, which lives in the [Workbench Agent Repo](https://github.com/fossid-ab/workbench-agent). Reach out if you have any questions!

## General Usage
This repo publishes a container image you can pull:

```bash
docker run ghcr.io/fossid-ab/workbench-agent-ce:latest --help
```

This shows the general Help message and lets you know the container is ready! Each command has its own help:

```bash
docker run ghcr.io/fossid-ab/workbench-agent-ce:latest scan --help
docker run ghcr.io/fossid-ab/workbench-agent-ce:latest evaluate-gates --help
docker run ghcr.io/fossid-ab/workbench-agent-ce:latest download-reports --help
```

The [Workbench Agent Wiki](https://github.com/fossid-ab/workbench-agent-ce/wiki) has more information on each command. 

## Quick Start
