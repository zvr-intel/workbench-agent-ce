    """
    Handler for the 'show-results' command.

    Fetches and displays results for an existing scan without running a new
    scan. This is useful for viewing results from previously completed scans
    or monitoring ongoing scans.

    Args:
        client: The Workbench API client instance
        params: Command line parameters including:
            - project_name: Name of the project containing the scan
            - scan_name: Name of the scan to display results for
            - show_*: Flags controlling which results to display
            - scan_number_of_tries: Max attempts to wait for scan completion
            - scan_wait_time: Interval between completion checks

    Returns:
        bool: True if the operation was successful

    Raises:
        ValidationError: If no --show-* flags are provided
        ProjectNotFoundError: If project doesn't exist
        ScanNotFoundError: If scan doesn't exist

    Note:
        This is a read-only operation that doesn't create or modify
        projects or scans. It will wait for in-progress scans to complete
        before displaying results.
