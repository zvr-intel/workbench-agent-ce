UploadService - Handles upload business logic and orchestration.

This service provides:
- Upload scan targets (files/directories with zip creation)
- Upload dependency analysis results
- Upload SBOM files

The service handles business logic and payload construction:
- Service layer: File preparation, header building, archive creation
- Client layer: Raw HTTP API calls

Example:
    >>> upload_service = UploadService(uploads_client)
    >>> upload_service.upload_scan_target(scan_code, "/path/to/source")
    >>> upload_service.upload_da_results(scan_code, "results.json")

    Service for upload operations.

    This service handles business logic for:
    - Preparing files for upload (creating zip archives for directories)
    - Building appropriate headers based on upload type
    - Deciding upload strategy (chunked vs standard) based on file size
    - Managing temporary files and cleanup

    Architecture:
    - Service layer: Prepare Files, Build Headers, Decide Upload Strategy
    - Client layer: Raw HTTP API calls (standard and chunked implementations)

    Example:
        >>> upload_service = UploadService(uploads_client)
        >>>
        >>> # Upload a scan target (file or directory)
        >>> upload_service.upload_scan_target(
