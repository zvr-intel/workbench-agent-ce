ResolverService - Resolves project and scan names to codes.

This service provides logic for finding or creating
projects and scans based on user-provided names.

The service provides both:
- Low-level explicit methods (find_*, create_*) for precise control
- High-level convenience methods (resolve_*) for "find or create" pattern
- ID reuse resolution (resolving ID reuse source names to codes)

    Service for resolving project and scan names to codes.

    This service orchestrates ProjectsClient and ScansClient to handle
    the common workflow of looking up or creating projects and scans
    by name.

    Public API:

    **Find only (raises if not found):**
        >>> resolver.find_project("MyProject")
        >>> resolver.find_scan("MyScan", "MyProject")

    **Resolve (find or create both project and scan):**

        ...         "MyProject", "MyScan", params
        ...     )
        ... )

    Usage Guidelines:
    - Use find_* for read-only operations
      (show-results, evaluate-gates, download-reports)
    - Use resolve_project_and_scan() for operations that may create
      (scan, scan-git, blind-scan, import-sbom, import-da)

        - If resolution fails, warns and returns None (allows scan to continue)

            id_reuse_any: Reuse any existing identification from the system
