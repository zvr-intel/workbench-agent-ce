Custom exceptions for Workbench API SDK.

This module defines the exception hierarchy for the Workbench API client SDK.
All SDK exceptions inherit from WorkbenchApiError to catch SDK-specific errors.

When distributed as an independent SDK, consumers can catch these exceptions
to handle API-related errors gracefully.
